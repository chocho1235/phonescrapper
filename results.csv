Twice now, about a year apart from each other, I’ve had to wait 15 mins for someone to appear on the til to serve me.\n\nFirst time this happened, a year ago, there was simply nobody on the til even though they could see me waiting. I punished them by leaving the money for my item on the til and walked off with the item. It’s not stealing because I left them the money. I just inconvenienced them as they could no longer scan the item. They should’ve seriously not ignored someone waiting on the counter. You’d hope they learn their lesson.\n\nSecond time, yesterday, the dumb cashier was serving this person for about 15 mins and was stuck serving them. Any normal person opens the second til and serves the people behind them. Not this brainiac. He felt it more efficient and logical to make the whole queue wait whilst he re scanned a whole week’s worth of shipping for an employee. That’s what makes it worse - the person he was serving was an employee. She understood what was going on and even offered for him to serve me first but he said no. He was struggling to workout how to scan each item too. Scanning items made him incredibly confused in this very simple process.\n\nInstead we all had to wait 15 mins for this one til to open whilst he scanned an entire week’s worth of shopping for seemingly no apparent reason, and is incapable of thinking of a logical way to clear the queue\n\nI’ve been shopping in Tesco for over 40 years and this is clearly the worst run one I’ve been in."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""C RG"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVhpfmBAjm9VHh1N8H09-J8dKyiz0RYhn3JN_HL-HEOuRxSBjrghw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Fairly convenient, but inconsistent.

This was my first time visiting this branch. Whilst my brother was asking questions regarding the medication, the employee who was serving my brother kept staring at me which I found very strange, he became very aggressive towards my brother and told him he was unable to sell the medication to him, he started to accuse me of giving him a fake £50 note last Monday. I tried to assure him that he has got the wrong person but he continues and became more abusive and threatened to call the police at which point I told him if he believes it was me then he should go ahead and call the police and I would be happy to wait for them to turn up. The employee who accused me then called security and told him to watch me whilst he checked the CCTV. I explained to security what I was being accused of and he confirmed that it was not me and he had never seen me before.\nAt this point the manager has come to the shop floor and I explained again what I was being accused of. The security confirmed to the manager that he had not seen me before and I am not the person who the employee is talking about. The manager aggressively asked security to move away. The store manager asked me for my details which I provided, when I asked him for his details to raise a complaint he refused to provide me with any details. I managed to get his name off his name badge which was Hasid. I left the shop and returned to see if they had viewed the CCTV footage.\nI told them I was not leaving until the police were called as they falsely accused me of committing a crime. The management assured me that the situation would be dealt with and he would call me to let me know what the outcome is.\nThe way in which the employee and management presented themselves was appalling and unprofessional. I have never felt so embarrassed in my life. I was not offered any form of apology, instead the employee was hiding behind the counter, knowing full well that he made a false accusation. I have some footage of the events that took place for my records should you need to see it.\nI hope that this complaint is investigated and the manager and staff member are held accountable for their actions.

with my last visit exactly to this place at this address and I don't advise to anyone to come here. Service and attitude towards customers is disrespectful and rude. I came in on a Saturday 22.02.25 night and got a sandwich, a salad and ordered an ice soy latte at the bar. The employee asked if I would eat there or take away, I replied that I would eat here, but they didn’t even offer me a tray, as is usually the case in other places. Afterwards I sat down at a table opposite the bar and waited for my drink to be prepared, but one of the employees did not announce that the drink was ready and took it to completely different people. I waited for a while and when I saw that the bartender was not making any drinks and was not busy with anything, I went up to ask for my drink, to which he told me that someone had taken it and my answer was quite logical, that it was not me and I asked him to make me my drink. And instead of apologizing and making my drink, for which I paid, he began to prove to me that someone took my drink and it was not their fault. But I still managed to get my drink prepared for me and I thought that that was it and the situation was over, but no I had to sit and wait until all the people were served, when all the other people's drinks were prepared, after that I just started looking at the guys and only after that they noticed me. And then one of the employees, instead of just giving me my drink, started telling me that next time I should listen when they announce drinks, to my response that he did not do this and immediately gave the drink to completely different people, he came right up to my table and rudely began to insist on his opinion. I felt a very hostile attitude and tone and did not understand at all why someone in the workplace could behave so rudely with customers. To sum it up, I would like to say that you should be more attentive to the recruitment of personnel or at least conduct appropriate training for them and explain how to communicate with clients. And I just made an order at your place, but I got such a bad mood and total disrespect that I will never come to this establishment again, if you are ready to part with your customers so easily because of the rudeness of your employees, then this is very upsetting."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Alan YDR"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUba_bhQU8VQoELhad-Iqhkcw24TOznz_hRdrm_ZoA_cBSX7U1a=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great spot to grab a quick lunch or snack.

experience at this Pret location yesterday.

Since she wasn’t fasting, she was going to order upon arrival, and then I would order after her. While waiting, I briefly looked at the food section to decide what I would have later before returning to my seat.\n\nWithin minutes (exactly 5-7 minutes after I entered the shop), a staff member approached me, stating that the seating area was for customers only and that I needed to make a purchase. I tried to explain that my friend would be arriving shortly and ordering, after which I would also be ordering, but the staff member walked away before I could finish. The whole interaction felt rushed and dismissive.\n\nFeeling shocked and unwelcome, I waited a few minutes for the staff member to return, but he didn’t. I then approached other employees to explain the situation, and their response suggested that sitting for just a few minutes without ordering shouldn’t have been an issue, though their attitude felt a bit awkward and clueless.\n\nWaiting for a friend before ordering is completely normal in any cafe.

Like many I can recall when John Lewis was sinonimous with the very best in Customer Service... this is no longer the case. Taking money in the retail business can be viewed as pretty important. The queues for making payment are simply unacceptable in a day when Oxford Street was NOT BUSY. My lunch order in the restaurant was not what I asked for at all but I accepted on the basis of the long queue behind me. The chilled water is almost obscured from view and it takes forever to fill a glass...you guessed it more queues. The toilets ok if you are male long queues for females but as someone pointed out....long queues of males waiting for their partners. John Lewis.....you have work to do. Sort these issues out or lose your customers. I don't want that to happen as I have been a loyal customer for many years."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Coral Williams"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIh3XISni6p-d6E8XX9AELr0b3qiw_D9x7Htq7JzYfxcJ6qfA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Visited today and had a nice drink on the top floor balcony it was beautiful.\n\nHowever for me the star of the show was the young lady at the Coach section she was so helpful and kind she was able to answer all of my questions her customer service was above and beyond.\ni would highly recommend having a look as the staff are so lovely and friendly but not too pushy which is amazing!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Michael Reardon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbr8d6kBvPMulSIt-HdDhPJbFbndnFlGU8Xv-VYwvSNRSc89H6_A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We visited the cafe on the fifth floor for a sandwich and a pot of tea on a Friday afternoon.

I noticed  the perfume area, as we strolled through the store, feeling quite peckish, from previous visits to the store had knowledge that they served hot food and beverages and had also been and had tea and cake which is amazing it was now time to try John Lewis‘s hot, my friend wanted to try fish and chips, and I felt to go for the leek and soup, I also wanted to try chunky chips and the fresh bread roll, the first waitress who served us behind the fish and chips counter was a Oriental lady, who ignored us twice, and then walked off to the back when we wanted to order.\nThe second lady serving the hot food was super friendly.\nShe even helped us carry the food tray to the table she was amazing and very helpful\nMy friend also ordered a pot of tea and I had water.\nUnfortunately, the cod was very cold. The chips were nice and warm. My soup was piping hot. I feel sometimes I’m lucky because I seem to always get the good end of the meal. We shared the breadstick. I asked my friend how his fish was he told me it’s okay It’s edible. The taste must’ve been nice, but it was a bit cold,\nI wanted my friend to taste the soup and let him share some of my soup in a separate bowl.\nAlthough he did manage to finish the fish chip peas and the butter bread I gave him,\nI really enjoyed my soup, It was tasty fresh hot full of flavour the bread was soft and fresh with my favourite butter Anchor, my friend told me his Tea was amazing, the and sandwich options healthy options will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes again. The pie looked amazing, and we decided to go for some desserts as this was John Lewis speciality, last time we had the double chocolate cake which was amazing and we stuck to one of the favourites cherry and raisin cake as it was so good.\nThe cake was so delicious and perfectly baked soft filling of vanilla cherry sauce was dreamy we both enjoyed the water very hydrating after the cake."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQOEpgu4ZxUMIPHVqt6_0hF78PTBNAFQh_LV67\u0026fid=0x0:0x42e145a62bba2664""],""When"":""2024-5-18""},{""Name"":""Gary Jelks"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXZtYIusKtYjpQYMIGVtNXFtxBaBlXDhpmmrCYp_Vrl4TTesA8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Great place to shop.\n7 floors of goods to choose from.\nHigh end goods at reasonable prices.\nStaff friendly and helpful.\nRestaurant on floor 5 is good value.\nGood choice of electrical goods and toys.\nGround floor filled with perfume and make up concessions.\nBeen many times and will continue to return.\n\nSadly a return visit at the end of 2024 summed up the decline of this once great store.\nWe wanted an iron and the website showed 12 in stock in store. We went to the kitchen department and there were none on display. The Shop assistant said they were sold out. We went to the cash desk and asked them to check their stock levels as the shop assistant did not offer to check. They said they had some in stock, but if the shop assistant said there were no left then that must be the case. We questioned how their stock records could be wrong and asked if they could send someone to the stock room to check. After a 5 minute wait, the iron we wanted was brought to us.\nWe summised that 2 shop assistants did not want to help us. Their motto is \""Never knowingly undersold\"". You can see why when they don't want to sell you the item in the first place.\nIf I could have bought it online, I would have done and will consider this next time.\n\nUnfortunately the quality of their employees has dropped considerably over the last couple of years and you can see this across all of their stores.\n\nNot good John Lewis.
